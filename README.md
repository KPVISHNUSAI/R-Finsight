# FinSight

FinSight is a modern, AI-powered financial analysis platform designed to provide key insights, detect anomalies, and forecast financial trends. Built with Next.js and Genkit, it offers a suite of tools for intelligent financial management, inspired by the professional aesthetic of Relanto.

## Features

-   **Interactive Dashboard:** A central hub for viewing key performance indicators (KPIs), revenue trends, and expense breakdowns.
-   **AI Report Generation:** Create custom financial reports from natural language prompts. The output is rendered in Markdown for clear, structured results.
-   **Anomaly Detection:** Upload financial data (JSON, CSV, Excel) to have an AI identify suspicious transactions, security risks, and other irregularities.
-   **Financial Forecasting:** Generate a 6-month financial forecast based on historical data, complete with visualizations.
-   **Conversational AI Assistant:** Chat with "Insight," an AI assistant knowledgeable about the platform's features, to get help and analysis.
-   **Responsive Design:** A clean, modern interface that works seamlessly across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

##  Why It’s Useful for a Company:

-  Saves time by automating reports.
